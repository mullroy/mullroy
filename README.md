Select <u>File</u>-><u>Import Viewing Key</u> and paste this key into the dialog. Wait for T.C. to rescan the blockchain to gather all data related to this address. The address for this viewing key can be copied
from the <u>Receive</u> tab:
<i><b>zs14zwr990548vdh607scctpn4z53uyxjmxyakcxf7dslc6c9pctnc0kkqw7v4063gklvpzzwrgrx9</b></i>.<br>
Go to the <u>Transactions</u> tab and paste the address into the search bar. This will filter the transactions to
only show entries related to this address. You can further filter it down by settting the filter from 'All' to 
'To yourself'. This will ensure that you only see the transactions posted by me. On each transaction with the
type: <i>Internal with Memo</i> you can right click and select 'Show Memo' to view the message.<br>
If you'd like, you can send me a message by making a small payment, like 0.1mArrr to this address. Include your
message in the memo field of the transaction.<br> 
<b>Note:</b> Even though the Pirate blockchain is private, everybody with this viewing key will be able to view 
and read all the memos of all the transactions associated with this address.

When you filter on <i><b>zs14zwr990548vdh607scctpn4z53uyxjmxyakcxf7dslc6c9pctnc0kkqw7v4063gklvpzzwrgrx9</b></i> plus
set the filter to 'To yourself', you'll see a couple of transactions. Look for the single transaction
on 21 September 2022. In the memo it provides a new address to send your queries to, plus instructions on what to
put in the memo field. This new address is not public and only viewable by the development team. Therefore, nobody
else will be able to see your transaction and question in the memo.<br>
<b>Very important</b>: As per the instruction, please include <i>your</i> address in the memo
so that we can send a reply back to you. We can't see from where the transaction was send. As such, there's no
"auto reply" address to use.
