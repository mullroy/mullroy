Select <u>File</u>-><u>Import Viewing Key</u> and paste this key into the dialog. Wait for T.C. to rescan the blockchain to gather all data related to this address. The address for this viewing key can be copied
from the <u>Receive</u> tab:
<i><b>zs14zwr990548vdh607scctpn4z53uyxjmxyakcxf7dslc6c9pctnc0kkqw7v4063gklvpzzwrgrx9</b></i>.<br>
Go to the <u>Transactions</u> tab and paste the address into the search bar. This will filter the transactions to
only show entries related to this address. You can further filter it down by settting the filter from 'All' to 
'To yourself'. This will ensure that you only see the transactions posted by me. On each transaction with the
type: <i>Internal with Memo</i> you can right click and select 'Show Memo' to view the message.<br>
<b>Note:</b> Even though the Pirate blockchain is private, everybody with this viewing key will be able to view 
and read all the memos of all the transactions associated with this address.

When you filter on <i><b>zs14zwr990548vdh607scctpn4z53uyxjmxyakcxf7dslc6c9pctnc0kkqw7v4063gklvpzzwrgrx9</b></i> plus
set the filter to 'To yourself', you'll see a couple of transactions. Look for the single transaction
on 21 September 2022. In the memo <b>another address</b> is provided to send your queries to, plus instructions on what to
put in the memo field. This new address is not public and only viewable by the development team. Therefore, nobody
else will be able to see your transaction and questions in the memo.<br>
Very important:<br>
1 Do not send your queries to 'zs14zwr990548vdh607scctpn4z53uyxjmxyakcxf7dslc6c9pctnc0kkqw7v4063gklvpzzwrgrx9'. Get the
new address from the memo field of the transaction dated 21 Sept. 2022.<br>
2 As per the instruction in the memo, please include <i>your</i> address in the memo of the transaction you 
send to us so that we can send a reply back to you. We can't see from where the transaction was send (paid). As such,
there's no "auto reply" address to use.
3 If the process seems too cumbersome, drop me a message at barrrter.com under the hardware wallet advertisement.
